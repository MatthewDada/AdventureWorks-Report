# Portfolio Projects 
## AdventureWorks-Report
My first PowerBI project. 

In this project, I made four pages of interactive dashboards that show in deep details-- the profit, revenue, returns, and return rates across the years. 
It also shows the distribution of the customers across the globe.
The product detail page shows the minute details about the categories and subcategories.
The customer detail page shows the customers and their details in the company. 

It was really great working on this project alongside the Udemy course-- Microsoft Power Bi for Business Intelligce (2023). 
I look forward to more projects based on the knowledge amassed in this course.
